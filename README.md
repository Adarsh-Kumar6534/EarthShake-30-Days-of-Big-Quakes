# EarthShake-30-Days-of-Big-Quakes

This repository contains a comprehensive notebook focused on the cleaning and analysis of earthquake data using Python and data science libraries. The goal is to prepare the dataset for meaningful exploration and possible future modeling.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The notebook loads a CSV file named `earthquake_data.csv`, checks for missing values, and performs cleaning operations to ensure the data is ready for further processing.

### Main Tasks Performed:
- Null value inspection and imputation
- Filling missing numerical columns like:
  - `Station Count`
  - `Azimuth Gap`
  - `Distance`
  - `RMS`
  - `horizontalError`
  - `magError`
  - `magNst`
